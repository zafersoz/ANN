# ANN

I developed an artificial neural network model on a fish dataset with 9000 image data content.

I decided that the most suitable architecture was 5 layers.

I added 2 drop layers for regularization (for overfitting problem).

I converted the 3D image data for the model into a numerical numpy array. Because the model works with 1D vectors.

I used Adam optimizer for optimization. I tried various learning rate ratios and decided on 0.0001.
